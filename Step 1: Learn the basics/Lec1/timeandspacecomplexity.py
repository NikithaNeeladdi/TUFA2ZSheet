BigO - worst case opersations 
Time complexity is the the no of operations performed to completed the solution
Omega - Best case
Theta - Average Case
for i = 0 ; i < n ; i ++
    for j =0 ; j <n=i:j++
    
    Time complexity is O(n*(n+1)/2)
    
Space complexity = Auxiliary space + Input spcace
     space needed to execute and solve the program 
     space needed to store the inputs
    ****never update the inputs (values or variables) unless interviewer mentions
    
usually all the coding platforms are hosted on servers
Each of this servers approximates uses 1sec ~ 10^8 operations
*** if asked to write a code which runs in 1 sec => its time complexity must be O(10^8)
